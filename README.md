# MKODO iOS Technical Challenge

## Workspace (Modules) layout

```
+ --- Workspace
    + --- App
    + --- API Service
```
## Chosen architecture

MVVM pattern is used.

## Known issues - Decisions

- Because of limited time I didn't implement some kind of coordinator pattern for navigation.

- For better testing and readability I could use Builders to create scenes and I could write some kind of contracts for behaviours and communication of viewModels and views.  

- Detail view scroll feature memory management system could be updated.
